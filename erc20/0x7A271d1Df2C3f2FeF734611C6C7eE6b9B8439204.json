        "en": "ET is the abbreviation of EXX Token. On July 9, 2018, ET was officially issued, with a total amount of 10 billion, and will never be issued. ET is a proof of the rights of the EXX trading platform itself. It is based on the Ethereum ERC20 agreement and is the only global certificate of the EXX platform. As an important part of the EXX ecosystem, ET will be applied to the application environment of the EXX entity ecosystem in the future. ET holders share various rights such as community governance and are the cornerstone of the collaborative development of EXX community members. Holders enjoy the corresponding rights of ET's entire ecology and enjoy the scarcity of ET's continued repurchase and destruction.",
